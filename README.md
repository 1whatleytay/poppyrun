# poppyrun - Implementation of language defined by the poppy parser.

Made after Abbey Park Hackathon 2020.
This was a challenge to see how fast I could implement the language.
I enjoyed making it, it was fun playing around with node and discord.js.

The poppy parser is defined [here](https://github.com/1whatleytay/poppy).
